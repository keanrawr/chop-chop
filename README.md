# Chop Chop

![Chop Chop](img/logo.png "Chop Chop")

This is a static website for my stuffed bunny (Chop Chop). Why make a website for a stuffed bunny you ask? Well, it's mainly for testing aws code pipeline and static website hosting.

# About the static website

The static site is built from the [Colorlib Melan Template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/melan/).
